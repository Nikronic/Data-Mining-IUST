    "The most important feature of search engines is that they must provide result based on their relevance. But to\n",

    "learning methods to achieve some score for each possible result or any combination of them. Let's go throughout the\n",
    "some of methods such as Classification, Clustering, etc to clarify the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification** enables the machine to differetiate between different classes of contents. For instace, you looking\n",
    "for a laptop for you needs, so the machine should be able to classify the content on the websites into different\n",
    "categories and show you the results that only contain the classes you looking for. As we said there are billion of\n",
    "websites out there so by just classifying the entire data into few categories (your keywords) the search space will\n",
    "be much smaller to analyze for other steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider the effect of **Association Rules**. Consider previous example which you wanted to buy a laptop.\n",
    "It is a general case and after searching it you might not find wat you were looking for. Search engine needs more\n",
    "keyword to specificly find your interests. So you add a laptop for teaching purposes. So, by adding this keyword,\n",
    "search engines knows some rules that people who bought these type of laptops, also might need microphone and a good\n",
    "webcam too. So if you try to search for mic or camera, you will get mostly results related to match with the\n",
    "requirement of having a lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is **Anomaly Detection**? In previous example, you are a student and looking for a mid-range devices because\n",
    " you need only a mediocre voice quality plus simple webcam to just communicate better. Mostly you are engaged with\n",
    " slides rather than your face! Anomaly means something that is not usual within results. In our case, most of the\n",
    " population who want laptop, mic and camera might be students or university lectureres, but gamers are here too. They\n",
    "  need much more powerfull mic and cameras. So if you are student, you are not looking for a 2K resolution! Here the\n",
    "  population wit less quantity is anomaly and need to be considered with different rules. Another example for this\n",
    "  can be the typo in another languages. For instance, in middle eastern countries, most of the people forget to\n",
    "  switch language to english and write their keywords in Arabic script. In this case a undefined word is being used\n",
    "  enormously only for few IP ranges. So it triggers and alert and make the search engine to learn that anomalous\n",
    "  behavior and convert it to a feature!\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Clustering** is similar to classification but with this difference that the distance metric is the core of\n",
    "  clustering which enables us to rank different results based on their distances to different center of clusters.\n",
    "  Clusters provide topic-based results which also can be incorporated within an another cluster where enables\n",
    "  hierarchical understanding of different topics and catergories. Clustering can be used for group of people in a\n",
    "  particular location, for instance, people in middle east search for different clothes in summer than people in\n",
    "  Russia. Or another case would be you looking for a specific keyword but it is rare or you don't enjoy the result,\n",
    "  then search engine use clusters and replace the word you used by a more related word using underlying meaning of\n",
    "  the keywords based on the clusters they are near to.\n",
    "\n",
    "  PPS:\n",
    "  1. Note that all of the previously mentioned approaches can be combined and even can be embedded within each\n",
    "  other to\n",
    "  provide more robust algorithms.\n",
    "  2. Also, I have mostly used \"word\" and \"keyword\" as the input. Same definitions can be used for all type of inputs\n",
    "  such as music or images."
