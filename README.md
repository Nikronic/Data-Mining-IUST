# Data-Mining-IUST
This repository contains the assignments of Data Mining course taught by Dr. Minaei at IUST

## Contents
You can find explanation in each folder. In this section, there is just summary of each work folder:

### Anomaly Detection in Stream using RRCF
In this work, I have prepared a report of paper RRCF by Amazon which has been used to detect anomaly in stream data.
This folder contains the report of the paper and presentation slides.

### Data Mining in Dota 2
In this work, I have introduced Dota 2 game, as a complex multi-objective, multi-agent problem and introduced different usage of regression, clustering, etc on high-level manner as a possible solution to issues like balancing the game, proper matchmaking, etc. This folder only contains a report file.

### Fast Decision Trees
In this work, Fast Decision Trees has been introduced as the replace for the conventional decision.

### HW01
This work contains information about using different data mining techniques in search engines, different distances, dimensionality reduction, undersampling and data cleansing.

### HW02
In this work, different clustering methods, SMC and Jaccard distance, implementation of DBSCAN from scratch have been discussed and resolved.

### MiniHW01
In this work, a majority of prominent metrics in data mining field have been compared to each other for different use cases. Also their benefits and downsides have been discussed too.

### Rule vs. Tree
The differences between rule learning approaches and tree based approaches have been discussed in this work.

### Project
In this work, DeepPath paper has been discussed thoroughly that is a deep learning based approach to the Graph Knowledge Reasoning task. I have introduced a few ideas to improve the original ideas based on some other papers which you can find the ideas on the report and presentation files. Also, a fork of original repository has been made to apply new changes(WIP).

## Acknowledgment
I have used many contents from different websites which I have not referenced! I have bookmarked all those references and I will update the slides or at least provide the links at each folder.

## Course Content
Slides can be shared upon request. Please send me an email (available on [nikronic.github.io](nikronic.github.io) or if you could not find it, contact me by creating an issue.
Videos are also available but I highly suggest you to use another resource.
